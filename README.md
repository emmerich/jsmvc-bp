MVC JavaScript Boilerplate

What is this?
========
A boilerplate application combining the following aspects:
* Backbone & Underscore for MVC
* RequireJS for AMD
* Jasmine for Unit Testing
* jQuery for DOM manipulation
* Underscore templates for templating
* Maven for building and continuous integration
* JSLint for sanity checking (maybe)
